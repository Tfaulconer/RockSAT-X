### Introduction
The RockSat-X program provides customers a standardized, convenient way to deliver their payloads to a microgravity testing environment. The RockSat-X sounding rocket has an ejectable skin and nose cone that will expose customer payloads to the space environment fully at an apogee of 150-170 km. For more information please refer to the [RockSat-X 2019 Website](https://spacegrant.colorado.edu/national-programs/rs-x-home) 

The UNL RockSat-X payload experiment goal was to collect accelerometer, gyroscopic and GoPro data in a microgravity environment to help researchers at NASA Langley Research Center characterize, develop and streamline a mechanism for a deployable boom.
